Data and code for some of my ML course

There are several different scripts here including the use of neural networks to bypass Benford's test, Building a support Vector classifier to differentiate PCA reduced clothings of different categories ie male or female in this case etc. I make use of PCA again in the LBA to deconstruct and reconstruct Images fromt he Berlin wall.
